<h4>Myth: You just need to train your reactive dog!</h4>
<br>
Fact: Training reactive dogs can take years and often requires highly controlled environments. Encountering off-leash dogs when attempting to train a reactive dog can set a dog's progress back by months.
<br>
<h4>Myth: Your dog would be fine if it were let off-leash!</h4>
<br>
Fact: While leash frustration is a common contributor to dog reactivity, there are many dogs who are reactive, fearful, or aggressive even when off leash. Individual dog guardians are best equiped to understand their dogs and determine what situations are safe, especially in consultation with a certified dog trainer.
<h4>Myth: Your dog must be dangerous because it has a muzzle on!</h4>
<br>
Fact: While muzzling is commonly used on dogs who have a propensity to be aggressive, not all dogs wearing muzzles are dangerous. Muzzles can be effective tools for preventing dogs from eating foreign objects which can cause obstrutions, or also give dog guardians peace of mind when taking their dogs into new environments. If you see a dog with a muzzle on, make sure you inquire with the dog's guardian to understand the reason they're using a muzzle.

<h4>Myth: You just need to teach your dog who the alpha is!</h4>
<br>
Fact: Alpha theory is a debunked dog training theory which has limited to no use in modern dog training. Various dog training methods such as force-free and balanced dog training options exist and should be exercised in conjunction with a certified dog trainer. Individual dogs will respond differently to various training methods. Never attempt to "dominate" an unknown dog.
