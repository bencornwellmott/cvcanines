While there are a very limited number of designated off-leash areas in the Comox Valley, a number of on-leash parks are frequented by off-leash dogs, creating unsafe situations for dog guardians who rely on signage indicating the park is on-leash. The map below provides information for pet guardians on where they are allowed to take their pets.

Keep in mind that the above map provides details about the designated status of the labelled parks, but other park users may not be complying with the designation.
