<div id="offleash-spaces-p">
<br>
Currently, there is only one designated off-leash space in the area, which can be inconvenient for dog guardians who are looking for a safe and fun place to exercise and socialize their furry friends.
<br>
Our goal is to work with local government and community members to identify potential locations for new off-leash areas. By increasing the number of designated off-leash spaces, we hope to promote responsible dog ownership and provide a safe and fun environment for dogs to exercise and socialize.
<br>
Off-leash areas are an important aspect of responsible dog ownership, as they allow dogs to run and play freely in a safe and controlled environment. They also provide an opportunity for dogs to socialize and interact with other dogs, which can be important for their mental and physical health.
<br>
We understand that not everyone may be in favor of designated off-leash areas, which is why we will work closely with local government and community members to address any concerns and ensure that new off-leash areas are located in appropriate and safe locations.
<br>
Overall, our goal is to create a more inclusive and dog-friendly community by increasing the number of designated off-leash areas in Comox. We believe that this will promote responsible dog ownership and enhance the well-being of both dogs and their guardians.

<div id="onleash-spaces-p">
<br>
We are also pursuing an initiative to improve enforcement of leash bylaws in on-leash spaces in Comox. This is aimed at providing a safe space for reactive dogs and their guardians, who may feel more comfortable in on-leash areas where they have more control over interactions with other dogs and people.
<br>
By improving enforcement of leash bylaws in on-leash spaces, we hope to create a more inclusive and dog-friendly community. This will help to ensure that reactive dogs have a safe space to exercise and socialize, without the risk of unwanted interactions with other dogs or people.
<br>
We understand that not all dogs are the same and that some dogs may require additional support and training. That's why we will work closely with local government and community members to provide resources for training and socialization, in order to help dog guardians build stronger bonds with their dogs and improve their overall behavior.
<br>
Overall, our goal is to create a more welcoming and inclusive community for all dogs and their guardians in Comox. By improving enforcement of leash bylaws in on-leash spaces, we hope to promote responsible dog ownership and enhance the well-being of both dogs and their guardians.
