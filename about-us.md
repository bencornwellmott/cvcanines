We are a group of passionate dog guardians who are dedicated to creating a safer and more inclusive space for all types of dogs and people. Our mission is to promote awareness and understanding amongst dog owners and community members on how to behave with and around dogs to ensure everyone's safety and well-being.

Our group works tirelessly to lobby local government and promote positive change in the community. We believe that every dog has the right to a happy and healthy life, and it's our responsibility as guardians to ensure they receive the love and care they deserve. We work towards improving services for dogs and their guardians in our community, such as advocating for more off-leash areas, providing resources for training and socialization, and promoting responsible dog ownership.

We understand that not all dogs are the same and that each one has their own unique needs and personality. That's why we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment that celebrates all dogs, regardless of their breed or background. We believe that by working together, we can create a safer and more compassionate community for all.

Thank you for visiting our website and joining us in our mission to promote a safer and more inclusive space for all dogs and people.
